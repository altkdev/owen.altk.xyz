                 Hi am Owen the original creator of ALTk. Like everyone else i realy like programing and making websites. I created ALTk in 6th grade. I started making websites for school prodjects in 5th grade and didnt think anything about it. when i created ALTk it was titled "class" as "hELLO.html" and you can still find it today. I knew i acualy wanted it to be named ALTk because of the keyboard shortcut you had to press to activate the main attraction. ALTk wasnt even Apple or Mobile compatable and only thing you could do was press alt + k from then it would redirect you to the actual youtube video. i found out this was not realy effctive because it would show the title before the video loaded and they knew what i was trying to do. When i realised Krish was good at coding i asked him for help. Without him ALTk wouldnt be how it is right now.

                  I like apple shortcuts. When i dont have ideas for ALTk i think of something to make a shortcut out of. in shortcuts apps can create their own actions but that means you would need that app to run it. when i make my shortcuts i try to make them with the built in actions. on one of my shortcuts i have almost 300 downloads. One of my shortcuts got posted in a blog it compresses multiple images, (<a href="https://blog.routinehub.co/how-to-compress-images-on-iphone-with-an-apple-shortcut/">The blog</a>), (<a href="https://routinehub.co/user/dr-comeemeememem">my shortcuts</a>)
