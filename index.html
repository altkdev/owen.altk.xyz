               Hi, I am Owen, the original creator of ALTk. Like everyone else, I really enjoy programming and making websites. I created ALTk in 6th grade. I started making websites for school projects in 5th grade and didn't think much about it. When I created ALTk, it was titled "class" as "hELLO.html" and you can still find it today. I knew I actually wanted it to be named ALTk because of the keyboard shortcut you had to press to activate the main attraction. ALTk wasn't even Apple or mobile compatible, and the only thing you could do was press Alt + K. From then on, it would redirect you to the actual YouTube video. I found out this was not really effective because it would show the title before the video loaded, and they knew what I was trying to do. When I realized Krish was good at coding, I asked him for help. Without him, ALTk wouldn't be how it is right now.

               I like Apple shortcuts. When I don't have ideas for ALTk, I think of something to make a shortcut out of. In shortcuts apps can create their own actions, but that means you would need that app to run it. When I make my shortcuts, I try to make them with the built-in actions. On one of my shortcuts, I have almost 300 downloads. One of my shortcuts got posted in a blog; it compresses multiple images, (<a href="https://blog.routinehub.co/how-to-compress-images-on-iphone-with-an-apple-shortcut/">The blog</a>), (<a href="https://routinehub.co/user/dr-comeemeememem">my shortcuts</a>)

               I am in Scouts. We go on campouts once a month and spend all of Saturday doing fun activities. In my troop, every year we go to summer camp. Every 4 years we go out of the council for summer camp. We have our meetings on Mondays, and I made a lot of friends there. I am going for Eagle and want everyone else to join Scouts because it is a really fun experience, and you learn good skills.
