                 Hi am Owen the original creator of ALTk. Like everyone else i realy like programing and making websites. I created ALTk in 6th grade. I started making websites for school prodjects in 5th grade and didnt think anything about it. when i created ALTk it was titled "class" as "hELLO.html" and you can still find it today. I knew i acualy wanted it to be named ALTk because of the keyboard shortcut you had to press to activate it. ALTk wasnt even Apple or Mobile compatable and only thing you could do was press alt + k from then it would redirect you to the actual youtube video. i found out this was not realy effctive because it would show the title before the video loaded and they knew what i was trying to do. When i realised Krish was good at coding i asked him for help. Without him ALTk wouldnt be how it is right now.
